# our-lists
Share lists with friends, family or co-workers, and collaborate in real-time.

The goal of this project was to become familiar with Ionic, Angular UI-Router, and how to store data in the browser's local storage.

I have also begun to incorporate WebSockets using Socket.io to enable users to share, create and edit notes with friends, family or coworkers in real time.
